        Engineering is the application of science and mathematics to solve problems. 
        Engineers figure out how things work and find practical uses for scientific discoveries. 
        Scientists and inventors often get the credit for innovations that advance the human condition, 
        but it is engineers who are instrumental in making those innovations available to the world.
        In his book, "Disturbing the Universe(opens in new tab)" (Sloan Foundation, 1981), physicist 
        Freeman Dyson wrote, "A good scientist is a person with original ideas. 
        A good engineer is a person who makes a design that works with as few original ideas as possible. 
        There are no prima donnas in engineering."
