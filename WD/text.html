    <p>My name is Nitin Sikarwar</p>
        <p>The Night King is a fictional character appearing in the HBO high fantasy television series Game of Thrones,
             based on George R. R. Martin's novel series A Song of Ice and Fire. He is depicted as the leader and the 
             first of the White Walkers, having existed since the age of the First Men, and is the most dangerous and
              powerful of his race. The Night King is an original creation of the television adaptation, thus far having
